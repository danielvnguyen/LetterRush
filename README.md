# What is Letter Rush?

Letter Rush is a text-UI game about quickly typing words that contain
the given characters. Each player has a limited number of lives,
and if the timer runs out before you can enter a valid word,
you lose a life.
# Rules & Info
- There must be at least two players to play; each with three lives
- After a certain amount of game time, the difficulty will increase (more characters & less time)
- If a word has already been used within a game, it cannot be used again
- The game will keep track of how many wins each player has, and display the results at the end of each round
